The project involves using a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to classify pet images as either being of a dog or not, and to correctly identify the breed of dog for images that are of dogs. The goal is to determine which of the three specified CNN model architectures is the most effective in achieving these objectives. The time and resources required to achieve these objectives will also be considered, with the possibility of finding an alternative solution if necessary.
